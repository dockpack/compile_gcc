# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
This ansible-role can compile gcc. That allows a lot of bad things to happen. Don't blame us!
Ken Thomson said in Reflections on Trusting Trust: "To what extent should one trust a statement 
that a program is free of Trojan horses? Perhaps it is more important to trust
the people who wrote the software."

[Create a GitHub issue in this repo](https://github.com/dockpack/compile_gcc/issues) to report a vulnerability.
