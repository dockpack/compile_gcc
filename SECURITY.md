# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
This ansible-role can compile gcc. That allows a lot of bad things to happen. Don't blame us!
In 1984 *Ken Thompson* said in [Reflections on Trusting Trust](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/358198.358210): _"To what extent should one trust a statement 
that a program is free of Trojan horses? Perhaps it is more important to trust
the people who wrote the software."_

[Create a GitHub issue in this repo](https://github.com/dockpack/compile_gcc/issues) to report a vulnerability.
